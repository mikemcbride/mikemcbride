### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I like building things that make developers more productive. I'm currently working on developer productivity at [@nytimes](https://github.com/nytimes). Before that I built web apps, frontend and API tooling, and deployment automation at [@wwt](https://github.com/wwt). Some things I've made that you might find useful:

- [Flexbox Playground](https://flexbox.tech) - a web app for visually building flexbox layouts. It generates all the markup and styles you need to implement that layout.
- [Box Shadow Generator](https://box-shadow.dev) - a web app for generating box-shadows. It generates the CSS needed to implement the shadow.
- [Color Conversion CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/convert-color-cli) - easily convert between different color formats (including transparent values) from the command line.
- [Electron Highlighter theme](https://mikemcbride.dev/electron-highlighter) - I made a color theme that you can use in a bunch of different applications. I like it. Maybe you will too.
